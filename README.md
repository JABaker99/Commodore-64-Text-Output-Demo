# Screen Customization & Text Output Demo

This Commodore 64 assembly program customizes the screen by changing the border color, swapping text and background colors, printing “HELLO,” and drawing colored heart characters in each corner of the display. It demonstrates structured subroutine design, VIC-II control, and text handling on the C64.
